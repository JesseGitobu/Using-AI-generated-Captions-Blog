                  <h2 class="most_text">Using AI-generated Captions to Help Deaf Students Watch Educational Videos</h2>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Over the recent past, the world has adjusted to the use of the Internet in almost 
                     all aspects of life; education has been at the forefront of integrating the change through online 
                     learning and providing educational material over the Internet. However, there are particular groups 
                     of people that do not get to enjoy the benefits that come with the internet. An example is the deaf and
                      hard of hearing (DHH) students who may find online learning to be inconvenient and difficult for them
                       to navigate. These students tend to rely on services such as captioning to have access to educational
                        material that is sent in visual audio form. While traditional captioning methods can still be helpful, 
                        they are often too costly, time-consuming, or both. This reduces the number of materials that can be 
                        made accessible. However, thanks to modern advances in artificial intelligence (AI), there is hope for 
                        newer and improved methods of creating both accessible and low-cost captions for DHH students in
                         the process of engaging with online learning materials.</p>
                         
                  <h3 class="second_text">The Problem: Accessibility Challenges for DHH Students</h3>
                  <p class="lorem_text"> Education equality is fundamental for everyone regardless of disability, as stated through the United Nations 
                     Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The CRPD also includes Article 24, which guarantees 
                     the right of persons with disabilities to access quality education that is inclusive and on an equal basis with the 
                     rest of individuals (de Beco, 271). Regrettably, DHH students experience multiple challenges in acquiring and consuming 
                     educational materials, primarily through the Internet (Graham & Choo, 37). The use of videos, lectures, and multimedia 
                     presentations has become customary in the institutions, which act as a great teaching aid for the students. However, 
                     these resources are, most often, unusable by DHH students if there are no captions or transcripts to the video or audio, 
                     which decreases their involvement with the content. This is because the majority of the videos are transcribed manually. 
                     When it is possible to create captions for these educational materials manually, the costs involved in the process are 
                     very high, and a lot of time is required. This limits the quantity of educational material that should be available for 
                     the DHH students. 
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     The accuracy of the captions is also a limiting factor. Manual captions depend on the concentration and knowledge of 
                     the person tasked with them. The information relayed by the actual speaker changes in meaning depending on the understanding 
                     of the person who captions the material. This reduces the opportunity for DHH students to understand the particular material. 
                     It is also clear that some educators and content creators do not understand the need for captioning, thus limiting the 
                     ability of DHH students to consume content. All these points that have been outlined clearly show the problems faced by 
                     DHH students in accessing online educational material and the unfair disadvantage that might come up after that.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="second_text">The Solution: AI-Made Captions</h3>   

                  <p class="lorem_text">By integrating artificial intelligence into captioning technologies, the problems of conventional captioning techniques can be solved 
                     adequately. AI-based NLP and speech-to-text or speech recognition technologies enable the creation of auto-generated audio and video 
                     content captions with near real-time speed (. Chen et al., 9). Some tech firms and several university laboratories have worked on 
                     captioning technologies offering lofty accuracy and speed. For instance, Live Transcribe from Google, Amazons Transcribe, and 
                     Microsofts Cognitive Services have provided the feature of real-time captioning that can be incorporated into applications and 
                     systems. This will offer a solution to many DHH students as they can follow through with live or recorded sessions without facing 
                     any delays. The AI system will also ensure that information is accurately transcribed. AI systems tend to undergo vigorous 
                     continuous training in a particular language and once trained the model maintains its consistency in captioning. AI systems can 
                     handle accents, dialects, and specialized terminology, reducing errors significantly.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Once implemented, AI captioning systems are more cost-effective than manual transcription. This is because they require minimal human 
                     intervention, thus reducing the long-term costs associated with captioning educational content. This makes it cheaper for education 
                     institutions and content creators to adopt, as it will ensure that DHH students consume content similar to their counterparts with no 
                     hearing impairment. Many AI-based captioning tools are easy to integrate into existing educational platforms. This makes it feasible 
                     for educational institutions to adopt this technology without extensive infrastructure changes. These are some of the ways that these 
                     AI-driven captioning platforms can benefit educational institutions and offer tremendous value as they are cheaper and more flexible t
                     han other methods. As a result, DHH students can have easier access to a broader array of academic materials, including live classes, 
                     webinars, and video lectures, without relying on pre-captioning or transcription.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="second_text">Literature review</h3>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Introducing AI-driven video captioning systems can benefit deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals since they can easily access particular 
                     videos. Based on chapter one of the Artificial Intelligence Index report, there has been an increase in AI publications within the 
                     academic sector, which accounted for about 81% of the total publications (AI INDEX REPORT, 8). This shows that there is potential in 
                     developing this solution to help DHH students. However, despite recent technological advancements, critical areas are more challenging for 
                     most current AI captioning systems to solve accurately. Several literature surveys capture prior works on how visual content can be made 
                     available for people with hearing impairment and suggest how AI systems can be improved to allow better human-AI experience. A potential 
                     strategy for the integration of deaf communities could be the conversion of videos into sign languages. Chen et al. (12) proposed Signmaku, 
                     a system that employs AI to provide real-time ASL text-based video comments. The research article identifies ways in which making content 
                     available in the sign language of the deaf communities can bring consumers of the content from the subculture of people with hearing 
                     impairment.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     It is important to consider current strategies, structural strengths, and weaknesses when designing and implementing a feasible, more efficient 
                     captioning system. According to Graham and Choo (34), a quantitative analysis of errors needs to be conducted to compare the accuracy rate 
                     for algorithmically generated captions across multiple platforms. Their research findings can help us understand which platforms work 
                     better in what cases and under what conditions. They suggest that Using AI only to develop captions for higher education videos does not 
                     meet the legal requirements as they are only about 89% accurate; thus, there is a need to incorporate manual captioning to help deal with 
                     the accuracy issue. Piskorek et al. (22) looked at how group editing can make AI captions more correct in their research "Evaluating collaborative 
                     editing of AI-generated live subtitles by non-professionals in German university lectures." Their results show that letting many users fix 
                     and change captions together in real time greatly reduces mistakes and makes captions more accurate. This group approach works especially 
                     well in classrooms where being right is very important. The study suggests that adding a feature for group editing into the AI caption 
                     system could use everyone's ideas to improve captions together, making sure they are as correct and helpful as possible for deaf and 
                     hard-of-hearing students.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Extensive research has been done in artificial intelligence, specifically on its role in helping people with other disabilities, such as 
                     visual impairment. While these studies focus on different disabilities, the methods and technologies discussed are very relevant. Liu's 
                     research highlighted how AI can analyze and explain video content through audio for blind people. The idea of using AI to improve 
                     accessibility can be changed to make captioning better for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Understanding how AI helps people in 
                     different ways gives us a better way to make a complete captioning system that uses AI's full power to meet different accessibility 
                     requirements.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Efficiency and ethical considerations in AI Speech-to-Text are crucial before implementing such a system. In their article, 
                     Ramadan and Yousif (2) look deeply into the technologies behind speech-to-text changing how well they work and their effect on people. 
                     This article is very helpful for understanding the technical basics needed to make a strong AI captioning system. The writers discuss 
                     different speech recognition technologies and their use, focusing on balancing how well technologies work with important ethical ideas 
                     like privacy and securing information. Considering these ethical standards is important for making an AI system that works well and follows 
                     the rules, protecting user privacy and trust.

                  <h3 class="second_text">Implementation Strategies</h3>
                  <p class="lorem_text">For AI captioning tools to be successfully adopted in educational settings, careful consideration must be given to several key 
                     implementation strategies. First and foremost, these technologies need to be seamlessly integrated into existing learning management platforms 
                     through APIs. This allows captions to sync effortlessly with online course recordings and materials. However, more than technology is needed - captioning 
                     will only achieve its full potential if coupled with training initiatives for educators and content creators. Workshops and guidance 
                     materials can spread awareness of students' accessibility needs and showcase how AI tools operate. Customizing these systems for an 
                     institution's specific lexicon, terminology, and accents is important with extended use, so captions are tailored to each context.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Continuous improvement through machine learning ensures AI stays up-to-date as courses evolve. User feedback mechanisms 
                     provide an opportunity to capture accuracy issues and opportunities for enhancement. Students play a pivotal role in cultivating high-quality 
                     captions by reporting inconsistencies or errors. Their input furnishes valuable, real-time data to refine algorithms over time through 
                     targeted retraining. If integration, instruction, customization, and collaborative progress are prioritized, AI captioning can match the 
                     rapid pace of online education while proactively addressing accessibility. A user-centered, evolving framework for implementation 
                     maximizes benefits for all students.</p>
                  
                  <h3 class="second_text">Potential Benefits for DHH Students</h3>
                  <p class="lorem_text">Implementing AI-generated captions in educational systems offers students, educators, and institutions significant advantages. It enhances 
                     the learning experience of deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students by enabling them to fully participate in both live-streamed and recorded 
                     classes through timely, accurate captions. No longer would these students be at a disadvantage simply due to their sensory differences. With
                      captions, DHH students can stay engaged with real-time discussions and lectures without lagging behind their peers who do not have a hearing 
                      impairment (Liu, 58). This leads to increased engagement and a more dynamic, interactive learning process for these subgroups.
                      <br>
                      <br> 
                      Beyond benefiting DHH students, AI captions foster a more inclusive educational environment. They accommodate those with diverse learning 
                     needs, such as non-native English speakers who may struggle with heavy accents. Learners with certain disabilities like auditory processing 
                     disorders, can also leverage captions to better follow along with oral content. Making online classes welcoming to the widest range of students, 
                     despite their ability status, supports an equitable and participatory education system. AI technology efficiently satisfies growing legal 
                     requirements around accessibility in many countries. Using automated captioning saves institutions time and resources compared to manual 
                     transcription methods, helping them comply with anti-discrimination mandates.</p>
                  
                     <h3 class="second_text">Challenges and Considerations</h3>
                     <p class="lorem_text">Despite the significant positive impacts of AI-technology-generated captions for DHH students and regular students in 
                        learning, specific issues need to be considered while using them practically in education settings. Several factors 
                        come into discussion regarding this technology, especially the reliability and precision in the transcription of video 
                        captions done by AI systems. While the accuracy has increased, mistakes can be made, especially with specific scientific 
                        or discipline-related terms (Piskorek et al., 173). These shortcomings will require continuous enhancement and more AI 
                        training using disciplinary corpora to attain optimal results. Many existing systems are mainly trained in English 
                        language text, which might not be very beneficial when dealing with multilingual learners. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Significant efforts must be made to enhance and utilize AI modeling with different language data sets to address the 
                        globalized aspect of online education. It is also crucial to make AI captioning tools compatible with existing educational 
                        platforms and interfaces designed for persons with disabilities. This concerns the need to develop features that are easy 
                        for end users to use while being very flexible since the technologies involved in AI deal with the personal nature of an 
                        individuals data, regulatory measures for privacy and security have to be ramped up to properly provide adequate data 
                        protection measures while also creating trust amongst the stakeholders/clients (AI INDEX REPORT, 74). Last, providing 
                        educators and content creators with professional development and resources and ensuring they use these tools properly to 
                        support students learning will maximize the results. Addressing these issues ahead of time is critical as they might 
                        significantly enhance the advantages of AI captioning while mitigating the drawbacks.

                        </p>
                     <h3 class="second_text">Conclusion</h3>
                     <p class="lorem_text"> From a global perspective, AI-generated captions can enhance DHH students' access to online classes. AI can solve problems 
                        in access to education and learning materials, thus ensuring that all students across institutions and content creators gain 
                        equal access to educational materials and information. To capture the full potential of this technology, a coordinated attempt 
                        by numerous stakeholders is vital. Online educational organizations should, therefore, ensure that they incorporate AI captioning 
                        tools in their web-based tools and content and provide resources needed for implementing the AI tools and acquainting the users 
                        with them (Ramadan & Yousif, 6). These technologies should be embraced by content creators/educators, and proper training should 
                        be undertaken so that they aid students with hearing impairments efficiently and effectively. In addition, technology firms, 
                        research organizations, and advocacy groups need to work together to overcome the abovementioned issues and consider all the 
                        challenges and considerations. By collaborating, we can enhance the fine-tuning and development of AI captioning models, increase 
                        the range of languages and dialects supported, and ensure better data protection guidelines. Lastly, as a best practice, the DHH 
                        community has to be engaged throughout this process to ask them what they would like, how they feel about something, and whether 
                        or not the solutions found align with their needs and preferences. Only through collaborative processes can one design and develop 
                        a composite virtual teaching-learning environment that all students can afford and access.</p>
